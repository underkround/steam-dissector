# SteamDissector

SteamDissector is an library/service that can be used to fetch data from Steam, such as user info, user's games and game's details.

### Goals:

SteamDissector is primarily made for use in conjunction with [SteamDissector web ui](https://github.com/zemm/steam-dissector-ui).

Goal is to create a service that can be used to sort your Steam game library better, and answer questions such as:
* "What controller enabled games do I have?"
* "What multiplayer games my friend and I both own?"
* "Which game is the latest adventure game I have?"

### Dependencies and libraries used:

* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for cache, since the Steam store is pretty slow.
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [lxml](http://lxml.de/)
* [PyMongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
